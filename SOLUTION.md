# Notes

- Is the radius in meters?

- location always

- 500 meters

- provisional notifications

- Model-view-presenter
    - MVVM is overkill here, best for a reactive approach
    - MVP can help with the massive view controller problem
    - Makes it easier to implement other ways to visualize the data model, such as a table view with all the available sites, etc.
